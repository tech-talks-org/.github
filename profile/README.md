# Tech Talks Org Manifesto

## 1. Peer Collaboration Over Resource Overload

We commit to sharing tools, experiences, and best practices so that everyone can learn and apply useful conceptsâ€”without drowning in an endless stream of links, articles, and tools that no one has time to follow.

## 2. Quality Over Quantity

We prefer a few well-tested and immediately applicable resources over a continuous flow of materials that may never be used. If you share something, make sure itâ€™s relevant, useful, and easy to understand.

## 3. Discussion Over Simple Sharing

We are not a broadcasting channel. Every shared resource is a starting point for discussion and exchange, not just a link to scroll past.

## 4. Accessibility & Progressive Learning Over Overload

We want everyone to participate, regardless of experience level. If a topic is complex, we strive to make it accessible with clear explanations and examples.

## 5. Practical Experience Over Abstract Theory

We value real-world experiences and concrete projects more than pure theory. If youâ€™ve tried a tool or approach and it worked (or didnâ€™t), share your insights!

## 6. Sustainable Growth Over Frenetic Pace

Our goal is continuous and sustainable learning. We donâ€™t need to keep up with everythingâ€”it's better to deeply understand a few key concepts than to superficially skim through everything.

ðŸ’¡ _"Itâ€™s not about how much you know, but how much you can share with others."_  
Welcome to the group, and happy learning! ðŸš€
